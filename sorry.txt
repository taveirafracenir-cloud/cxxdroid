To the Android Open Source Project community and all affected contributors,

We sincerely apologize for the unintentional inclusion of code and/or design elements derived from the Android project in this repository. This was an oversight on our part and not a deliberate attempt to avoid proper attribution or licensing.

We acknowledge that portions of the project may be subject to the Android Open Source Project’s licensing terms (for example, the Apache License, Version 2.0) or other third-party licenses. We regret that the appropriate license notice and attributions were not included.

Actions we are taking immediately:
1. We will review the codebase to identify any files copied or derived from Android or other third-party projects.
2. For any such files, we will either:
   • add the correct copyright and license notices and retain the code in accordance with the original license; or
   • remove or replace the code with original implementations.
3. We will add a clear LICENSE file and attribution notes to the repository.
4. We will reach out to affected contributors or upstream projects if required and cooperate to remedy the issue.

We appreciate the work of the open-source community and regret any harm or confusion this oversight may have caused.

Sincerely,
The CXXDROID Team
